#Lab 2
    1. Below are two lists. Write a Python program to convert them into a dictionary in a way that item from list 1 is the key and item from list2 is the value.
Keys = [‘ten’, ‘twenty’, ‘thirty’]
Values = [10, 20, 30]
Expected output:
{‘Ten’: 10, ‘Twenty’: 20, ‘Thirty’: 30}
[Bonus]: Do it using dictionary comprehension.

    2. Create a dictionary and check if a given key exists in the dictionary or not.

    3. Concatenate two dictionaries into one.
d1 = {‘a’: 10, ‘b’: 20, ‘c’: 30}
d2 = {‘d’: 40, ‘f’: 50}

    4. Create a dictionary, take its values from the user, and then calculate the sum of all values in a dictionary.

    5. Create a dictionary which contains numbers between 1 and n as a key and the values are the square of these keys. (Using dictionary comprehension)

    6. Find out letters which are in the first string but not in the second string.

    7. Copy the content of an image from one file to another file.

    8. Create a dictionary from a list of strings where the first char of the string act as key and respective strings are stored as values. 
Take input from user, for example:
	apple orange avocado mango peach pear plum
	Expected output:
	{
“a”: [“apple”, “avocado”],
“o”: [“orange”],
“m”: [“mango”],
“p”: [“peach”, “pear”, “plum”]
}
