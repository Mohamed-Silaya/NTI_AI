# NTI_AI
## Python Lab 1
- 1 - Write a program that counts the number of vowels [a, e, i, o, u] contained
in the string
- 2 - Write a function that accepts two arguments (length, start) to generate an
array of a specific length filled with integer numbers increased by one from
start.
- 3 - Fill an array of 5 elements from the user, Sort it in descending and
ascending orders then display the output.
- 4 - write a function that takes a number as an argument and if the number
divisible by 3 return "Fizz" and if it is divisible by 5 return "buzz" and if is is
divisible by both return "FizzBuzz".
- 5 - Write a function which has an input of a string from user then it will
return the same string reversed
- 6 - Ask the user to enter the radius of a circle to alert its calculated area and
circumference.
- 7 - Ask the user for his name then confirm that he has entered his name (not
an empty string/integers). then proceed to ask him for his email and print all
this data.
- (Bonus) check if it is a valid email or not
- 8 - Write a program that prints the number of times the string 'nti' occurs in
- 9 - Write a function that takes a string and prints the longest
alphabetical ordered substring occurred. For example, if the string is
'abdulrahman' then the output is:
Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abdu
